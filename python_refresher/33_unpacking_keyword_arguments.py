"""
What Are Args?

*args are used to pass non-keyword arguments. 
Examples of non-keyword arguments are fun(3,4), fun("foo","bar").

*args are usually used as a measure to prevent the program from crashing 
if we donâ€™t know how many arguments will be passed to the function. 
This is used in C++ as well as other programming languages.
"""

"""
 What Are Kwargs?

**kwargs is a dictionary of keyword arguments. 
The ** allows us to pass any number of keyword arguments. 
A keyword argument is basically a dictionary.

An example of a keyword argument is fun(foo=2,bar=7).

**kwargs are just like *args except you declare the variables 
and the amount within the function arguments.
