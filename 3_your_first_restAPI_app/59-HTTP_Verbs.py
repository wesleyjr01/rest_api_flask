* What is a WEB server? This course is all about creating
WEB servers, so that kinda gives you a bit of a hint.
Definition: a WEB server is a piece of software designed
to accept incoming web requests.

* For example, Google has many web servers. Whenever we go
to http://www.google.com in our browser, we send something
to a web server. And when we send something to the web server,
the web server can then decide to respond back. It may not respond.
