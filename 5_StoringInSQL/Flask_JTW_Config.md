## Advanced Flask-JWT Configurations:
Attached to this lecture as a Resource is a short guide on how to configure Flask-JWTâ€”it includes things like:

* Changing the authentication endpoint (by default, ```/auth```);
* Changing the token expiration time (by default,``` 5 minutes```);
* Changing the authentication key name (by default, ```username```);
* Changing the authentication response body (by default, only contains ```access_token```); and
* Changing the error handlers.
