# Setting up Our Domain Name
* A domain name is essentially just a string, for example, "digitalocean.com" or "schoolofcode.me", they are two separate strings, and the way the domain system works is in such a way that it enables us to map those strings to locations on the internet. Once we've performed this mapping, our browser will be able to use that string to access a particular location, and that location is the server in which we have deployed our app.
* So what we're going to do is map a string, our domain name, to the IP adress. And the way we're going to do that is by using the domain name system. So the first step in setting up our domain is we must know our IP adress (IPv4 of our application in DigitalOcean), than we go over to a website called https://www.namecheap.com/, they will let you register domains.
* So now go ahead and search for the domain you want, for example <wesleybortolozo.com> and press Search. Press the option that you want, and add it to the Cart, now click on ViewCart. Unpress the Auto-Renew button. The next thing that is important is the **WhoIsGuard**.
* For every year that your domain is live, you'll waant a WhoisGuard live as well. It's normally paid (in the site says free forever), but what is WhoIsGuard? It prevents your personal register information to going public essentially.
* Now you can Confirm the Order.
