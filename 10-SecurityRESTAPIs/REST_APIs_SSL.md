# Welcome to this section

Hello, welcome to this section!

Security in REST APIs is extremely important, because often applications that use our REST APIs will be sending us all sorts of data about users: passwords, e-mail addresses, names, postal addresses, security questions, bank details, and more.

In order to prevent people from intercepting the data on the internet and being able to read it, we must use **Secure Sockets Layer**. This sits on top of HTTP and encrypts all communication between a server and a client.

What this means is that if someone does intercept traffic that is encrypted, they won't be able to understand it.

In this section we'll learn about enabling HTTPS (SSL) in our REST APIs.
